%	QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\question{How do I add a new question and answer?}\label{new-question}

In the code, type:

\begin{verbatim}
\question{A question that needs answering}\label{question-label}

The answer to this question.
\end{verbatim}

%------------------------------------------------

\question{Why is there a label in the code for \hyperref[new-question]{the previous question}?}\label{labels}

This is not necessary, but it does give you a way of linking to a different question. In order to link to another question you simply need to add the following:

\begin{verbatim}
\hyperref[question-label]{click here}
\end{verbatim}

The first part \texttt{[question-label]} is the label name and the second part \texttt{\{click here\}} is the text that is displayed as link.

%------------------------------------------------

\question{How do I change the title and subtitle?}\label{change-title}

To change the main title, simply find the "TITLE AND LIST OF QUESTIONS" block and replace "A Template for FAQ's" within it. To change the subtitle find the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
\newlistof{questions}{faq}{\large List of Frequently Asked Questions}
\end{verbatim}

and replace the subtitle with one of your choosing.

%------------------------------------------------

\question{Is it possible to change the spacing between the questions in the list of questions?}\label{change-spacing}

Yes, simply find the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
\setlength\cftparskip{.3em}
\end{verbatim}

and change the \texttt{.3em} to whatever suits your fancy.

%------------------------------------------------

\question{What if I want to hide the page numbers and/or trailing dots next to the question in the list of questions?}\label{page-numbering}

To remove the trailing dots to the page numbers, find the line:

\begin{verbatim}
%\renewcommand{\cftdot}{}
\end{verbatim}
and uncomment it. To remove the page numbers as well, find the following lines and uncomment them:
\begin{verbatim}
%\let\Contentsline\contentsline
%\renewcommand\contentsline[3]{\Contentsline{#1}{#2}{}}
\end{verbatim}

%------------------------------------------------

\question{Is it possible to number questions?}\label{number-questions}

Yes, you can refer to the number of the current question with:

\begin{verbatim}
\thequestions
\end{verbatim}
 
For example, this is question \thequestions. You can even incorporate question numbers into the questions and list of questions automatically by adding:

\begin{verbatim}
Question \thequestions:
\end{verbatim}

just before each \texttt{\#1} in the \texttt{\textbackslash questions} definition block in the preamble.

%------------------------------------------------

\question{Question \thequestions: Can I change the color of the question boxes?}\label{question-color}

Just find the following line and change the color specified there:

\begin{verbatim}
\todo[inline, color=green!40]{\textbf{#1}}
\end{verbatim}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
